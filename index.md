"Dodge Battle" is a take on Disney "Tron" - Disc Wars. 
 
 The objective is to either hit the opponent with your throwable, or have them fall off the stage. Each time a projectile bounces on a platform it will change colour dependant on which team hit last, if it is hit by the same team again (without another team hitting it before them) the platform will be destroyed. Players will have to keep vigilant of which platforms are still standing.
