"Dodge Battle" is a take on Disneys' "Tron" - Disc Wars. 
 
 The objective is to either hit the opponent with your throwable, or have them fall off the stage. Each time a projectile bounces on a platform it will change colour dependant on which team hit last, if it is hit by the same team again (without another team hitting it before them) the platform will be destroyed. Players will have to keep vigilant of which platforms are still standing.

Platforms are coloured based on the last team to hit it with a projectile, blue - friendly ; red - enemy ; white - none.

The image above displays the 2 players on either side of the play area, they are on different teams. As you can see the colours are dependant of their own team.

Projectiles can be thrown and caught (as long as its blue). A single hit will down a player from a red projectile.

Falling out of the world also causes a loss.
